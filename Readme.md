A CN dream or want: 
to be able to take a cellular device 
Save home computer (remote desktop) information on the phone.
Plug into any other computer 
Have icon show on that computer 
Double click and Desktop loads onto this computer.
</pre>
## Build Notes:
1) application needs to know what OS the home computer was.
2) application needs to realize OS of computer plugged into.
3) needs to save remote desktop info with whatever command needed.
4) application needs to have all phone cloud softwares ... as files auto downloaded on home directory.
## Data Transfer ... paralellized
splits half among phone cellular signal. 
other half among computer wifi.

but the idea is that the phone is continually sending to the cloud or otherwise.
could not store on phone and have your home computer software. No magic trick there.
When cell phones get better, small partition of your operating system on a phone hard drive could work. A home grown program could create those minimum backup partitions and transfers. Messing with mac computers might cause some complication because mac does not usaully like to play nice. (note: this was written on a mac. :) )
this remote solution is the easiest solution and could work on mac computers and potentially all other computers.
## Build Notes Mac
1) sharing needs to be enabled.
2) find relevant mac information... probably ifconfig
3) save this small amount of information onto the phone.
4) go to a new computer - mac for starters.
5) load from phone ... initiate remote desktop connection.
6) leave tips so that when users attempt to bring their files in, suggestions to upload to and download from cloud are created.
